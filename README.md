- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @chaispicedlatte
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in becoming a front-end developer. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML & JS and looking to get an entry-level job after I finish my bootcamp. 
- I love the outdoors, going on walks. Currently I am trying to find what I am passionate about and create my âœ¨dreamâœ¨ life that I deserve. 
- If you are into reading check out my 2 favorites, I hope they will guide you as much as they did for me: 
    - The Definind Decade 
    - The Power of the Subconscious Mind. 

Have a fabolous day, and even better week.
